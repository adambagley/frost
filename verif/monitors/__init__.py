"""Runtime verification monitors for DUT output checking.

This package contains monitor coroutines that run concurrently with tests,
continuously checking that DUT outputs match expected values.

Monitors
--------
regfile_monitor
    Watches the register file output valid signal (o_vld) and verifies that
    all 32 register values match the expected state when instructions retire.

pc_monitor
    Watches the program counter output valid signal (o_pc_vld) and verifies
    that the PC value matches the expected next PC for each instruction.

(Memory monitoring is integrated into MemoryModel.driver_and_monitor)

How Monitors Work
-----------------
Monitors are async coroutines started with cocotb.start_soon() at test
initialization. They run in parallel with the main test loop:

1. Test loop generates instruction and computes expected result
2. Test loop queues expected value and drives instruction to DUT
3. Monitor waits for valid signal from DUT
4. Monitor pops expected value from queue and compares
5. Monitor raises AssertionError on mismatch

This decoupled approach handles variable pipeline latency gracefully.

Usage
-----
Monitors are started automatically by test infrastructure::

    from monitors.monitors import regfile_monitor, pc_monitor

    cocotb.start_soon(regfile_monitor(dut, expected_regfile_queue))
    cocotb.start_soon(pc_monitor(dut, expected_pc_queue))
"""

    regfile_monitor,
    pc_monitor,
    Monitor,
    RegisterFileMonitor,
    ProgramCounterMonitor,
)
