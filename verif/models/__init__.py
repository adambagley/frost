"""Software reference models for CPU behavior verification.

This package contains reference implementations that compute expected results
for CPU operations. These models are used to generate expected outputs that
are compared against the DUT (Design Under Test).

Modules
-------
alu_model
    Reference implementations for all ALU operations including:
    - Base integer operations (add, sub, and, or, xor, shifts, comparisons)
    - M extension (mul, mulh, div, rem variants)
    - B extension (bit manipulation: clz, ctz, cpop, rotations, etc.)
    - Zicond extension (conditional zero)
    - Zbkb extension (crypto bit manipulation)

    Uses decorators for automatic result masking and shift limiting.

branch_model
    Branch decision logic for conditional branches:
    - BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU
    - Proper signed/unsigned comparison handling

memory_model
    Data memory interface model:
    - Byte-addressable memory with little-endian ordering
    - Support for byte, halfword, and word accesses
    - Driver/monitor coroutine for memory write verification

Usage
-----
The models are typically used by the CPUModel class in the tests package
to compute expected results for each instruction::

    from models.alu_model import add, sub
    from models.branch_model import branch_taken_decision

    result = add(operand_a=10, operand_b=20)  # Returns 30
    taken = branch_taken_decision("beq", 5, 5)  # Returns True
"""

from models.alu_model import add, sub, and_rv, or_rv, xor
from models.branch_model import branch_taken_decision
from models.memory_model import MemoryModel

__all__ = [
    "add",
    "sub",
    "and_rv",
    "or_rv",
    "xor",
    "branch_taken_decision",
    "MemoryModel",
]
