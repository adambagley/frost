"""Software model of the CPU's data memory interface.

Memory Model
============

This module provides a software model of the CPU's data memory interface.
It maintains a byte-addressable memory array that mirrors the hardware
memory state, allowing the testbench to:

    1. Drive read data back to the CPU for load instructions
    2. Monitor write operations and verify addresses/data
    3. Keep software and hardware memory synchronized

Key Features:
    - Byte-addressable memory (stored as dict for sparse representation)
    - Little-endian byte ordering for word/halfword accesses
    - Integrated monitor for verifying memory writes from DUT
    - Explicit instance passing (no global state)

Usage:
    The MemoryModel is instantiated once per test with the DUT:

        mem_model = MemoryModel(dut)

    Then passed explicitly to functions that need memory access:

        from models.alu_model import lw
        value = lw(mem_model, address)

    Store operations are monitored via the driver_and_monitor coroutine.
