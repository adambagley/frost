"""Utility functions for the verification framework.

This package provides helper functions used throughout the verification
framework for data conversion, logging, memory operations, and validation.

Modules
-------
riscv_utils
    RISC-V specific type conversions:
    - Sign extension for various bit widths
    - Signed/unsigned value conversions
    - Bit manipulation helpers

memory_utils
    Memory address and alignment utilities:
    - Address alignment functions
    - Byte enable mask generation for stores
    - Memory size calculations

instruction_logger
    Structured logging for instruction execution:
    - Formatted output with PC flow, register updates, memory operations
    - Coverage summary reporting
    - Debug logging for branch flush and pipeline operations

validation
    Enhanced assertion utilities:
    - HardwareAssertions class for RISC-V-specific validations
    - Register index bounds checking
    - Immediate value range validation

Usage
-----
Import utilities as needed::

    from utils.riscv_utils import sign_extend
    from utils.memory_utils import calculate_byte_enables
    from utils.validation import HardwareAssertions

    # Sign extend a 12-bit immediate to 32 bits
    signed_imm = sign_extend(raw_imm, bit_width=12)

    # Validate a register index
    HardwareAssertions.assert_register_valid(reg_idx)
"""

from utils.riscv_utils import sign_extend, to_signed32, to_unsigned32
from utils.validation import HardwareAssertions

# Note: InstructionLogger is not imported at package level to avoid circular imports.
# Import directly when needed: from utils.instruction_logger import InstructionLogger
