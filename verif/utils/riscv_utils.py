"""RISC-V type conversion utilities for sign extension and casting.

RISC-V UTILS
============

This module provides utility functions for RISC-V data type conversions:
- Sign extension for arbitrary bit widths
- Signed/unsigned 32-bit integer conversions
- 33-bit conversions for multiply operations

Constants like MASK32, XLEN, etc. should be imported from config.
"""

    Args:
        val: Value to sign-extend
        bits: Number of bits in the original value

    Returns:
        Sign-extended value as a Python int (unbounded)

    Example:
        >>> sign_extend(0xFF, 8)  # Extend 8-bit -1 to full width
        -1
        >>> sign_extend(0x7F, 8)  # Extend 8-bit +127 to full width
