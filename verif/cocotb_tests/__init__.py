"""Test cases and infrastructure for RISC-V CPU verification.

This package contains all CoCoTB test cases for the Frost RISC-V CPU.

Test Modules
------------

Random Regression Tests:
    test_cpu
        Main random instruction regression test (16,000+ instructions).
        Tests all instruction types with coverage tracking.

Directed Tests:
    test_directed_atomics
        LR.W/SC.W atomic memory operation tests

    test_directed_traps
        ECALL, EBREAK, MRET, and interrupt handling tests

    test_compressed
        C extension compressed (16-bit) instruction tests

Integration Tests:
    test_real_program
        Full system tests with compiled programs (Hello World, CoreMark)

Infrastructure:
    test_common
        Shared utilities (TestConfig, handle_branch_flush, execute_nop)

    test_state
        TestState class for tracking CPU state across pipeline stages

    test_helpers
        DUTInterface and TestStatistics helper classes

    instruction_executor
        InstructionExecutor class for simplified directed test writing

    cpu_model
        Software reference model for instruction execution

    instruction_generator
        Random instruction generation with constraints
