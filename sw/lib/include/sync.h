/**
 * Synchronization primitives for RISC-V (Zifencei extension)
 *
 * This header provides memory and instruction synchronization barriers
 * for use in bare-metal code. These are essential when:
 *   - Self-modifying code needs instruction cache coherency (fence_i)
 *   - Memory ordering guarantees are needed between cores/devices (fence)
 *
 * On Frost (RV32IMAB with Zifencei), these are effectively NOPs since:
 *   - No instruction cache exists (unified memory)
 *   - Single-core, in-order execution
 *   - No out-of-order memory system
 *
 * However, using these primitives ensures code portability to more
 * complex RISC-V implementations where they have real effects.

/**
 * FENCE - Memory ordering fence
 *
 * Ensures all prior memory operations (loads and stores) complete before
 * any subsequent memory operations begin. On simple in-order cores like
 * Frost, this is a NOP but ensures portability to out-of-order systems.
 *
 * The "memory" clobber tells the compiler not to reorder memory accesses
 * across this barrier.
