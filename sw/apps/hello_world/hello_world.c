/**
 * Hello World - Basic UART and timer demo
 *
 * Prints a greeting message every second, demonstrating:
 *   - UART output with uart_printf
 *   - Timer-based delays using delay_1_second()
 *   - Cycle counter measurement to verify clock frequency
 *
 * This is a good first program to run when bringing up new hardware.
